**Estep and Exclusive Autosport Claim 2016 Championship in Dominant Fashion in Formula Tour 1600**

> My first time racing the F1600 cars was an incredible experience. After only one practice session at full speed, my first time ever in the car, we managed to qualify 5th and move forward to finish 3rd on Saturday, and 2nd and 3rd on Sunday. The Exclusive Autosport guys gave me a car that could run up front easily, and it was just up to me to try to get up to speed as quickly as possible and extract what I could from the car. Overall, I was extremely pleased with the weekend at the beautiful Mont-Tremblant circuit. I'm very grateful to Michael Duncalfe for the opportunity to be a part of the team, and I can't thank my teammates, Trenton and Will, and everybody on the crew enough for making my learning curve as smooth as possible.
