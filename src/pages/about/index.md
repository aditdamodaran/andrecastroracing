Andre first jumped in a kart at the age of seven, beginning what was then a hobby competing in the local karting scene. He began to compete head to head against some of the best karting drivers in the nation at the age of thirteen, learning valuable lessons in race craft and discipline along the way.

Andre began his competitive car racing career in late 2015 during the Skip Barber Karts to Cars Shootout, earning a career advancement scholarship to compete the 2016 Skip Barber Championship Series. His performances in the Skip Barber championship attracted the attention of Jeremy Shaw, who invited him to participate in the Team USA Scholarship selection process - Andre advanced to the finalist stage of the competition, receiving coaching from Indy 500 champ Gil de Ferran and learning from IndyCar’s industry leaders along the way.

After a brief stint in USF2000 which saw Andre achieve two top tens in two weekends, Andre returned to competition in Colombia's 2018 3 Hours of Bogota, achieving a class victory. He turned to NASCAR in 2019 after being selected for the Whelen Euro Series Drivers Recruitment Program, achieving four podium finishes, one pole position, and two Rookie Trophy wins. Andre returned to USF2000 on a part-time basis in 2021, earning three top-ten finishes with a best of eighth in St. Petersburg, which once again got him nominated for the Team USA Scholarship. He proceeded to win the award five years after his first nomination, representing Team USA over several weeks in England, where he claimed a podium finish in the world's most prestigious Formula Ford 1600 race, the Formula Ford Festival.

2022 saw Andre tackling the Road to Indy's inaugural USF Juniors presented by Cooper Tires season for International Motorsport, finishing fifth place in the standings after earning the team's first ever podium in car racing. This strong start to the season earned him the opportunity from Al Unser Jr. to close out the F4 US Championship driving for Future Star Racing, where he earned four podiums in nine starts, finishing 8th out of 36 in the championship despite only competing in half of the 18 races.

2﻿023 began with a lone USF2000 start in St. Petersburg, Florida, which yielded a top 10 finish for Future Star Racing. On July 1st, Andre made his NASCAR Xfinity Series debut on the streets of Chicago with Jesse Iwuji Motorsports, qualifying 28th of 43 despite having zero testing or prior experience in an Xfinity car before the day of the race. He climbed up to 18th before the brakes overheated, cutting his day short. Andre is looking to make more starts in the Xfinity Series going forward with his partners at JIM and the eRacing Association.
