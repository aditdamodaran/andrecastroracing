description: Andre, a first-generation Colombian-American racecar driver, has
  been behind the wheel since he was seven. Even with limited resources and the
  added challenge of growing up in New York City, Andre has persevered to become
  one of the top young drivers from the United States, winning the prestigious
  Team USA Scholarship award in 2021. Aside from currently racing in the F4 US
  Championship and USF Juniors presented by Cooper Tires championship, Andre is
  a college student majoring in Economics with specialization in Business at the
  University of Chicago. He is also an avid actor, having participated as the
  lead role in several theater productions in high school and college. It's this
  unique blend of raw racing talent, a meticulous work ethic, and comfort
  performing in the spotlight that sets Andre apart. He proved himself at the
  50th Formula Ford Festival where, representing Team USA, he finished 3rd of 97
  entries in the most competitive Formula Ford 1600 race in the world. He was
  chosen off the back of this performance to lead International Motorsport's new
  team into the brand-new Road to Indy USF Juniors category for 2022, and earned
  the team's first ever podium with a 2nd place finish at Barber. This strong
  start to the season led to a call from Al Unser Jr. to complete the remainder
  of the F4 US Championship for Future Star Racing.
