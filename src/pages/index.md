description: Andre, a first-generation Colombian-American racecar driver, has
  been behind the wheel since he was seven. Even with limited resources and the
  added challenge of growing up in New York City, Andre has persevered to become
  one of the top young drivers from the United States, winning the prestigious
  Team USA Scholarship award in 2021 and reaching the NASCAR Xfinity Series in
  2023. Andre is a college graduate, obtaining his BA in Economics with
  Specialization in Business from the prestigious University of Chicago. He is
  also an avid actor, having participated as the lead role in several theater
  productions in high school and college. It's this unique blend of raw racing
  talent, a meticulous work ethic, and comfort performing in the spotlight that
  sets Andre apart. He proved himself at the 50th Formula Ford Festival where,
  representing Team USA, he finished 3rd of 97 entries in the most competitive
  Formula Ford 1600 race in the world. He made his NASCAR Xfinity Series debut
  in the inaugural Chicago Street Race for Jesse Iwuji Motorsports, representing
  UChicago Medicine and his alma mater, the University of Chicago College; he
  qualified his way into the race despite having no prior testing or experience
  in an Xfinity car.
