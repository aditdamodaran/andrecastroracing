description: Andre, a first-generation Colombian-American racecar driver, has
  been behind the wheel since he was seven. Even with limited resources and the
  added challenge of growing up in New York City, Andre has persevered to become
  one of the top young drivers from the United States, advancing to become a
  finalist for the 2016 Team USA Scholarship. Aside from currently racing in the
  NASCAR Whelen Euro Series, Andre is a college student majoring in
  Business-Economics at the University of Chicago. He is also an avid actor,
  having participated as the lead role in several theater productions in
  high-school and college. It's this unique blend of raw racing talent, a
  meticulous work ethic, and comfort performing in the spotlight that sets Andre
  apart. He proved himself to be a front runner throughout his rookie season in
  the prestigious NASCAR Whelen Euro Series, and he is looking forward to
  returning to Europe in pursuit of the 2020 EuroNASCAR championship with DF1
  Racing.
