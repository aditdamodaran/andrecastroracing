description: Andre, a first-generation Colombian-American racecar driver, has
  been behind the wheel since he was seven. Even with limited resources and the
  added challenge of growing up in New York City, Andre has persevered to become
  one of the top young drivers from the United States, advancing to become a
  finalist for the 2016 Team USA Scholarship. Aside from currently racing in the
  Cooper Tires USF2000 Championship, Andre is a college student majoring in
  Economics with specialization in Business at the University of Chicago. He is
  also an avid actor, having participated as the lead role in several theater
  productions in high school and college. It's this unique blend of raw racing
  talent, a meticulous work ethic, and comfort performing in the spotlight that
  sets Andre apart. He proved himself to be a front runner throughout his time
  in the prestigious NASCAR Whelen Euro Series, and he is looking forward to
  returning to the front of the grid with Marotti Autosport/Legacy Autosport in
  the 2021 USF2000 Championship.
