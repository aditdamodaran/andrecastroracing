title: Newcomers Shine at Chris Griffis Memorial Test
date: 2016-11-28T19:10:00.000Z
description: Matthew Brabham, the 2012 USF2000 champion who made his
  Indianapolis 500 debut earlier this year, posted the second fastest time
  overall while assisting six-time and defending champion team Cape Motorsports
  with Wayne Taylor Racing in its learning curve with the new car. A pair of
  Team Pelfrey teenagers, Kaylen Frederick, from Potomac, Md., and Robert
  Megennis, from New York, N.Y., both topped the times at one time or another,
  while fellow New Yorker Andre Castro, a standout rookie on this yearâ€™s Skip
  Barber Racing Series, also impressed in setting the fastest lap in the final
  session this afternoon. Castro stepped in today for New Zealander Brendon
  Leitch at Newman Wachs Racing, which is making its return to the sport
  following a seven-year hiatus.
