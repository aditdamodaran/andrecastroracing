description: DF1 Racing has found another piece of the puzzle for the 2020
  NASCAR Whelen Euro Series (NWES). The Austrians have signed Andre Castro from
  the United States, who will share the car with NWES legend Ander Vilarino and
  compete in the EuroNASCAR 2 (EN2) championship. The New York native wants to
  build on Lasse Soerensen’s success in 2019 and win the title as a DF1 Tiger.

In his debut season in 2019, Castro impressed with strong performances, which is why DF1 Racing has taken notice of the 21-year-old race driver. In eleven starts, he clinched four podium finishes and one pole position. Three times Castro finished second: in Valencia, Franciacorta und Brands Hatch. In his first oval race at Venray he finished in a solid fourth place. Unforgotten is his first race in Valencia, which he led until the last corner, until the dream of his first race win was shattered after a contact with Myatt Snider.

But in 2020, in his first full season in EuroNASCAR, Castro finally wants to climb to the top of the podium and finish the championship in first place: "I’m thrilled to mount an assault for the EN2 title with DF1 Racing. I will give everything to defend the title for DF1 Racing. I’m looking forward to rewarding the trust that Gudrun Strouhal and Norbert Walchhofer have in me. It’s an honour to work with NWES veterans like Ander Vilarino and Mike Law and I expect to learn a lot from them throughout the course of the season. I’m already counting down the days until my very first full season in auto racing finally begins in Valencia."

DF1 Motorsport Director Norbert Walchhofer is enthusiastic about the US American: "Andre has set himself a clear goal for the 2020 season: he wants to become the European NASCAR Champion when he flies back to his home country USA after the finale. This fits perfectly with the ambitions we have at DF1 Racing and I’ve always hoped that Andre would get in touch with our team, which in the end he did, fortunately. His talent perfectly completes the driver duo for the #22 car, which will be driven by Ander Vilarino in the EuroNASCAR PRO championship. We have a ‘tiger strong’ car with two absolute top drivers and I’m convinced that Andre can make his dream of winning the title come true in our team."

Castro’s first challenge will take place on April 25-26 at Circuit Ricardo Tormo in Valencia, Spain – a track that suited the 20-year-old well on his NWES debut. NWES and its teams will then visit Brands Hatch (UK), Most (Czech Republic), Venray (Netherlands), Vallelunga (Italy), Zolder (Belgium) and Hockenheim (Germany).
