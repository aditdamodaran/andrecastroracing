The Miami Grand Prix was a plethora of big names and familiar faces come race day on Sunday, but as well as hosting some of the biggest names in the NFL over the weekend with brother’s TJ and JJ Watt, Haas F1 Team saw the first race in Miami as a prime opportunity to welcome some national rising stars into the garage.

Kyffin Simpson, winner of the 2021 Formula Regional Americas Championship and current Indy Lights driver, and Andre Castro, a 2021 Team USA Scholarship Winner, joined the team for the weekend spending valuable time understanding what it takes both mentally and physically to reach the pinnacle of motorsport, all while getting to watch history being made with the debut of the FIA Formula 1 World Championship hitting the streets of Miami.\
\
Castro is no stranger to Haas F1 Team, having previously visited the team’s UK factory in Banbury, Oxfordshire alongside fellow Team USA Scholarship Winner, Max Esterson last year.\
\
Simpson and Castro spent the weekend immersed in the inner workings of a Formula 1 team – watching practice sessions and the race from inside the garage with full access to team radio to understand the communication between team and driver. They also sat down with Haas F1 Team drivers Kevin Magnussen and Mick Schumacher to ask about their junior careers and the journey to Formula 1, as well as getting to understand the vital and never-ending work of the mechanics and engineers.

“I had a great time at the Miami Grand Prix this past weekend getting to hang out with Haas F1 Team. I was very excited to get to watch the sessions and Grand Prix from their garage and listen in to their team radio, as well as meeting the drivers and Guenther Steiner. I had a great time, so a huge thanks to the Haas F1 Team for the experience,” commented Kyffin Simpson.\
\
“My first ever Formula 1 weekend was an incredible experience thanks to the invite and wonderful hospitality from Haas F1 Team. As a young racer on the track to hopefully becoming a paid professional driver, the Formula 1 paddock is an amazing place to network with an eye towards the future, and I was given the opportunity to do just that by Haas. Being a fan, speaking candidly with Guenther, Mick, Kevin, Gary, and Gene was the ultimate honor and something I’ll never forget. The atmosphere at this first-time event was tremendous, and I want to thank the whole Haas F1 Team for welcoming me with open arms, especially Stuart Morrison for giving us young American drivers the opportunity to explore the exclusive world of Formula 1,” shared Andre Castro.\
\
“We understand, maybe more than most, how vital it is to open the door of Formula 1 to young drivers, especially in America, so it was a privilege to host Kyffin and Andre last weekend. They’re both great talents with sensible heads on their shoulders and after spending the race speaking and engaging with our team, I hope it’s provided useful insight and motivation for them when making the next step of their careers – they’re always welcome to call upon us for advice and guidance,” said Guenther Steiner.
