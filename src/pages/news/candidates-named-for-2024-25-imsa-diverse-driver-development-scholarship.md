**O﻿riginal article:** https://www.imsa.com/news/2023/05/01/candidates-named-for-2024-25-imsa-diverse-driver-development-scholarship/

**DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. –** The field has been narrowed to 10 worthy candidates for the 2024-25 IMSA Diverse Driver Development Scholarship. The recipient, to be named later this year, will receive benefits worth more than $250,000 to assist them in competing in one of three IMSA-sanctioned series during the 2024 season.

IMSA Diverse Driver Development Scholarship candidates must be female or a member of an ethnic minority classification with a strong desire to compete in IMSA, have outstanding previous race results and/or proven on-track potential in junior racing categories, and the ability to create a compelling strategy to compete in the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship, IMSA Michelin Pilot Challenge or IMSA VP Racing SportsCar Challenge. Among the benefits of the scholarship are a full-season premium prepaid entry fee for 2024 in one of those series and 50 percent of the prepaid entry fee for 2025. Support for the scholarship also comes from IMSA partners Michelin, VP Racing Fuels, OMP, Bell, Recaro and LAT Images.

Over the next few months, the 10 selected candidates will participate in a series of learning modules to bolster their off-track skills and assist them in approaching teams and submitting their final business plans. The recipient of the 2024-25 scholarship will be notified in the fall.

The list of candidates for the third annual IMSA Diverse Driver Development Scholarship consists of eight men and two women. Four of the candidates were finalists in past years. Here are the candidates, listed in alphabetical order with hometown (*-designates a finalist in a previous year).
