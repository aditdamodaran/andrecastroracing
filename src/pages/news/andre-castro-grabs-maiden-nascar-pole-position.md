date: 2019-06-02T02:38:00.000Z
description: "The ELITE 2 Division was highlighted by the third different pole
  sitter in three events. Andre Castro, driving the #24 Camaro for PK Carsport,
  conquered his maiden NASCAR pole. The American rookie clocked a 49.281 seconds
  lap, which granted him the pole in his very first outing at the famous Brands
  Hatch Circuit. He won an incredibly tight battle with Florian Venturi in the
  very last seconds of the session, after exchanging the leadership with the
  Frenchman several times."

“I don’t know what to say, I’m so excited right now,” said 20-year old Castro. “You always dream about more. It’s all about winning the race. Here it came down to that one lap and we did it. It’s only six corners, I managed to have a decent lap. My team is really doing the best they can. They gave me an awesome car today and I’m looking forward to the race. I was pushing the whole time and trying to get the perfect gap from the guy in front of me. That worked out well.”\

Franciacorta ELITE 2 Round 4 winner Venturi will start second in the ELITE 2 Round 5 on Saturday. The Go Fas Racing driver ended up ahead of championship leader Giorgio Maggi, who was quick in the first part of Superpole but couldn’t match his two rivals in the closing minutes. Freddy Nordstrom will start fourth in his NWES comeback at Brands Hatch, while Valencia race winner Nicholas Risitano rounded out the top-5.\

Vittorio Ghirelli, who is also in contention for the 2019 ELITE 2 championship, was sixth ahead of local hero Scott Jeffs, Indian rookie Advait Deodhar, Myatt Snider and Justin Kunz, who closed the top-10. Q1 had to be red flagged once due to a technical issue for the #12 car of Naveh Talor, who ended up 22nd on the grid.\

Pulling double duties at Brands Hatch, NASCAR GP Italy race winner Lasse Sorensen was not able to set a lap time in qualifying due to an issue to his #66 Camaro. The Dexwet-df1 Racing driver will have a huge mountain to climb in the afternoon, when he will start from the very back of the grid in the ELITE 2 Round 5.\
